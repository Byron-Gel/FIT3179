        <h1>Comparison of STEM Jobs</h1>
        <p> This visualisation compares the total compensation of different STEM related jobs in the US. The data is sourced from "Levelsfyi.com" 
          using anonymous submissions from 2017-2021 therefore some data may be outdated and non-reperesentitive of the current market. The compensation
          from these companies is a combination of base salary, stock per year and their yearly bonus. The number of submissions is a good indicator of the 
          total abundance of jobs within the area/company but is not perfect.  With that being
          said, the visualisation may help inform current and future STEM graduats to aid them making informed and educated decisions in their career path.

        <h3>Average Compensation in Different Cities</h3>
          <p> The map below shows the total average compensation in different cities within the US aswell as the number of submissions. As seen in the map the 
            San Francisco Bay area has a highest density of high paying jobs indicated by the high concentration of large and circles in the northern part of 
            California. Despite the high demand for STEM related positions in the San Fransisco Bay area is high, the job market is competitive and the housing/
            cost of living is one of the expensive in the world. Good alternitive places include Seattle with a similar amount of submissions but with slightly 
            less compensation on average aswell as Austin and Dallas in Texas. Places to avoid would be Los Angeles with a low amount of submissions and New York
            with a low average compensation relative to rent/cost of living.

          <h3>Average Compensation at Different Companies</h3>
          <p>The bubble plot to the right shows the average compensation of different companies in the US. The companies are split into four categories; FAANG companies
            include Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, HFT companies are high frequency trading companies which are commonly thought of offering very lucrative
            contracts, Big Tech companies are defined as having more than 300 employees and and average compensation greater than 175k (not including FAANG companies). 
            All other companies have been grouped together in other. The top performing companies are located in the upper left 
            corner of the plot as those companies offer higher average compensation for the least amount of experience. Larger circles are more likely to offer more
            accurate results due to the large sample size and less likely to be effected by outliers. As seen from the plot are Snap (owned by Google) and Netflix 
            which are both FAANG (or owned by a FAANG) but have a relatively small sample size compared to the rest of the FAANG companies which may result in skewed results.
            Comparing the different categories, HFT's and FAANG companies performed relatively similar with five HFT's and 3 FAANG comanies paying more than 300k with FAANG 
            companies often hiring magnitudes of more people. The worst performing companies are companies in the Other category with majority of them paying less than 200k.

          <h3>FAANG Compensation's in Different Positions</h3>
          <p> The FAANG companies are shown to the right with the average compensation of different positions. Note that Netflix has been replaced by Microsoft as Microsoft
            has many more submissions and is more likely to have data more closely alligning to the companies current standards. Facebook and Google are outpaying most of
            the other companies in every position espiecally in software engineering manager, product manager and hardware engineering roles. Softwware engineering roles and
            data scientist roles are relatively similar within the FAANG companies all performing much better than the average with the exception with microsoft.

          <h2>Average Compensation at Different Companies</h2>
          <p>The plot to the right compares different companies in terms of career growth. The plot is split into four different categories, Graduate (0-1 years of experience),
            Early Career (2-5 years), Middle Career (5-10) and Late Career (10+). Only companies with 100+ submissions are shown but the average taken from all companies from 
            the dataset. the best performing companies for graduate companies are Netflix, AirBnB and Lyft. The best performing
            companies in terms of career growth are Snap, Netflix and Facebook with Snap resulting in the most growth by a far margin. THe worst performing graduate positions 
            also turn out to have the worst growth with both Deloitte and Accenture platueing well below the average.
